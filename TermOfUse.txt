These assets can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with or bought and sold among users. Any information we provide on the of Platform, such as pricing, listing, and sourcing is for informational purposes. Also, Company has no control over and provides no guarantees related to: the existence, accuracy, quality, safety or legality of items advertised or user content; the ability or legal standing of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that any user will complete a transaction or return an item.

This license does not include any resale or commercial use of the Platform data, or its contents; any collection and use of any software information, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of any service or its contents; any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party; or any use of framing, data mining, robots, or similar data gathering, viewing, and extraction tools.

<size=60><color=#006EFF><b>NFT License</b></color></size>

Some Digital Assets sold or created on the Platform may include NFTs. When obtaining, selling, or purchasing an NFT, you agree and understand what characteristics NFTs have and how the following terms apply to their sale. An NFT is a digital tool that can, but does not always, represent real-world objects such as photographs, videos, writings, or music. NFTs are usually built using similar technology to digital currencies. But, while digital currencies are usually fungible, NFTs usually are not. Each NFT is coded into a blockchain and contains built-in methods for evidence of authentication and proof of ownership. When you buy an NFT, the terms of your purchase, and the rights you actually purchase and own, may be limited by the terms or technology of the underlying NFT. It is up to you to confirm your understanding of what you are selling or buying and the license you are receiving which is determined by the seller in its sole discretion. The license to any purchased NFT is a matter between the seller and buyer, and Company is not a party to the licensing transaction. All licenses and all ownership interests in any Digital Asset, such as NFTs, shall pass directly from seller to buyer. 
You further understand that blockchain transactions are usually not reversible. You understand that NFTs and other Digital Assets may only exist by virtue of the ownership record maintained on a blockchain, and further that smart contracts are conducted and occur on decentralized ledgers. Company has no control over and makes no guarantees or promises with respect to such smart contracts or the functioning of such blockchain or the persistence, or lack thereof, of the NFT or related content. In cases where a transaction involving a Digital Asset is revealed to be fraudulent or illegal or an infringement, or a buyer or seller acts fraudulently or illegally or in an infringing manner, then the defrauded or injured buyer/seller shall have no recourse against Company, but solely against the respective seller/buyer. 
Sellers of Digital Assets are responsible for providing all necessary information in compliance with all applicable law and regulations regarding such Digital Assets in applicable listings on the Platform.
